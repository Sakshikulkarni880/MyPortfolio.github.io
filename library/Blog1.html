    <h3 id="blog" style="color: white;">How to use YouTube while learning a new skill?</h2>
    <div class="container-blog">
        <p><b>It is really very hard now-a-days to find the correct playlist from YouTube to learn that one skill.</b><br>
        <p>Being an engineering student, I can understand the problem, because after just typing the title we get lots of playlists and really its impossible to find that one playlist with which you are comfortable with.<hr>
            <img class="hero image " src="/images/calculations.svg" width="350" height="350">
        </br>After that one decision, watching it without any distraction and disturbance is the biggest dilemma. So, after facing same problems I just researched about it and I got some ways to watch any playlist without any disturbance.</p>
   <hr> </br><b><h4>1. Downloading Videos</b></h4> <img class="hero image " src="/images/Download.svg" width="350" height="350"><p> 
    It is helpful for many issues such as network connectivity and also your video becomes ad-free too.</p>
</br> <hr>  <b> 2. Participate in the Online Community</b><img class="hero image " src="/images/Rename.svg" width="350" height="350"><p> Think of YouTube as a collective learning platform, where you can post comments, ask questions and share your thoughts on the videos that you watch. The video instructor may even have a separate online community that you can sign up for if you want to connect more with the instructorâ€™s teaching.</p>
<b> <p style="text-align: center;">I personally tried it and it is awesome!</b> </p>
<hr>
</br><b>3. Keep a Notebook Handy:</b></h3></br><img class="hero image " src="/images/add note.svg" width="350" height="350"><p></p><em>The more YouTube videos you will have in your learning collection, the more difficult it will get for you to remember all the information that you have gleaned from these various videos. So, get into the habit of making notes for every video that you watch.</p></em>
<hr>
</br>As per me this are the three main points that a beginner must know before learning it from YouTube.
